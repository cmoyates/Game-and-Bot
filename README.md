# Game and Bot

This is a small game made with Unity that demonstrates several of the techniques I learned in the final semester of my Computer Science degree (and a bot that plays it).

This includes:
- Procedural Content Generation
- Vector Field Pathfinding
- Steering Behavior
- Simple AI Exploration Strategies
